        <li>This 9th Community Playthrough is ONLY for Pok&eacute;mon Fire Red and Leaf Green on official Nintendo video game consoles. Do not discuss emulation in chat!</li>
        <li><strong> <em>To join, inform an <a href="#event-organizers">event organizer</a> which version you'll be playing and your challenge/theme run, if any.</em></strong> The challenge/theme can be changed at any time!</li>
        <li>Inform a staff member of the following each week:
            <ol>
                <li>Current team (state if any Pok&eacute;mon are shiny or have a different OT</li>
                <li>Total play time</li>
                <li>Number of Pok&eacute;mon SEEN</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>This information should be delivered through PMs on <a href="//play.pokemonshowdown.com/pokemongames" target="_blank">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown!</a> or with Lady Monita's .mail command if staff is absent.</li>
        <li>If unable to complete the current checkpoint, <strong>contact a staff member and request to be escused.</strong> You are still expected to update upon reaching that checkpoint.</li>
        <li>If you don't update before the weekly deadline, <strong>you will be dropped from future checkpoints.</strong> To rejoin the CP, you must submit data for all missed checkpoints.</li>
        <li>Hacking is prohibited. However, almost all in-game choices, including glitches, are permitted.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not progress further in the story</strong> until the next checkpoint has started!</li>
        <li>This is a community playthrough, the idea is for members to go through the game together.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following are the Pokemon Games room auth members that primarily handle the recording process. PM them first, and only send weekly updates to other room auth if none of these loggers are online.</p>

    <ul class="staff">
        <li>A Quag to the Past</li>
        <li>6Roggenrolas</li>
        <li>CaMe827b</li>
        <li>BringBackCaramel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The log takes a minimum of 5 minutes to update; wait that long before asking if it was forgotten or resending.</p>
    <p>Registration formally ends after <strong>March 15th</strong>. Join by that date for guaranteed entry!</p>
    <p style="text-transform: upperace;">Even if you join after Checkpoint 1 has been finished by most, be sure to let organizers know when you complete it!</p>

    <p>These are the different goals we will be hitting each week of the playthrough.</p>
    <p>Once you complete a checkpoint, you can of course keep playing, but dont break the boundaries set by the checkpoint!</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="cp1">Checkpoint 1</a>:</strong> Defeat Brock, Misty, and a third Gym leader to obtain three badges (March 9th-15th) [Don't obtain a fourth badge]</li>
        <li><strong><a href="cp2">Checkpoint 2</a>:</strong> Defeat four accessible Gym Leaders to obtain a total of seven badges (Marth 16th-22nd) [Don't enter the Viridian Gym]
            <ul>
                <li>These will be Lt. Surge, Erika, Koga, Sabrina, and Blaine, not including whichever leader you defeated in Checkpoint 1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong> <a href="cp3">Checkpoint 3</a>:</strong> Defeat Viridan's Gym Leader, the Elite Four, aand the Champion (Marth 23rd-29th) [You may also explore Cerulean Cave before updating].
            <ul>
                <li>There is no log for checkpoint 3; data will be added directly to the Hall of Fame submission sheet by players.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="desc">While glitches are generally allowed, keep the following restrictions in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A CP run will not be considered valid if the listed goals specified in these checkpoints are subverted (ask staff if you're worried that you might be doing something of this nature)</li>
        <li>They should not be used to skip major Team Rocket segments, as those are part of the CP! (at Mt. Moon, Lavender's Tower, Celadon hideout, and Silph Co.)</li>
    </ul>
